# Localized command aliases and display configuration
# Change the ISO 639-2 language reference to the language of your choosing. A subdirectory must exist for it, containing TaskLocale configuration files.
# It's too bad environment variables can't be automatically expanded. :/

include ~/.task/tasklocale/epo-RUS/taskrc

# Honor any settings in the user's .taskrc file.
include ~/.taskrc

# Header messages are suppressed in order to avoid constantly mentioning that we're using this alternate taskrc file.
